    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          There’s something weird about watching the BBC lately. It’s like walking into a familiar room and realising someone’s moved all the furniture around just enough to make you trip. The headlines still look “proper,” the presenters still sit upright like they’ve been ironed flat, but the whole thing feels… tired. Recycled. Like they’re reporting the news from a distance so nobody gets upset.<br><br>
          Scrolling the BBC homepage, you can literally feel the safety net. Everything’s balanced to the point of being bland. A crisis here, a political apology there, the usual “record-breaking something” article, but you’re left thinking: Where’s the edge? Where’s the honesty? Where’s the bit where they admit things are actually going to shit?
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          People my age don’t trust the BBC the way adults assume we do. Not because it’s “biased,” but because it’s polished to death. When everything is sanded smooth for TV, the truth starts slipping off the edges. We don’t need another “government sources say” paragraph — we want the reality underneath: the strain, the impact, the stuff nobody wants to say out loud.<br><br>
          The BBC isn’t evil. It’s just… slow. Heavy. Too careful. And the world right now is anything but careful. Maybe that’s why so many of us end up getting our updates from TikTok at 3am — yeah, it’s messy, but at least it feels awake.

    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          From 2nd December 2025, trans girls are banned from joining Girl Guide groups within the UK. Why was this decision made, and do you agree with it?<br><br>
          This new decision means that girls who were assigned male at birth will no longer be able join Girl Guide groups. The trustees within the organisation that oversees these groups says, <span class="news-source">“Trans girls and young women and others not recorded female at birth, will no longer be able to join Girlguiding as new young members.” They also said that there would be no changes for young women who are already members but more information on this topic will be shared next week. – BBC News.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Many people from the public think it is unfair and discriminative against trans women. <span class="news-source">TransActual said: “There is no problem being solved here, only harm done.”</span> My opinion, this ban seems unfair because every girl should have the right to join. This decision excludes girls who only want to belong by being who they are. – <span class="news-source">BBC News</span>.<br><br>
          What do you think – should all girls be allowed to join, or do you agree with the rules that are set in place?

          There’s something underrated about the tiny stupid moments that carry us through the day. Like when someone in your group chat sends a meme so unfunny it becomes actually hilarious. Or when you and your friends laugh so hard in the corridor that a teacher appears out of nowhere like a summoned demon.<br><br>
          Fun at this age isn’t planned. It just happens. It sneaks in between lessons, during the silent bits in class when someone coughs weird, or when you’re walking home hyped on nothing but fresh air and delusion. We don’t get “weekend trips to the coast” fun — we get “laughing for ten straight minutes because someone mispronounced a word” fun.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Adults always talk about “making memories” like it’s some strategic project. But the memories that actually stick are the chaotic ones — the inside jokes, the random late-night FaceTimes, the moments where everything is stupid and pointless and perfect.<br><br>
          Fun isn’t deep. It doesn’t need to be. It’s the crack in the wall that lets the light through when everything else feels heavy. And honestly? Those tiny dumb moments are what keep half of us sane.

    <div class="article-title">West Hallam’s Dog Choir Wakes Residents</div>
    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.<br><br>
          The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>
          Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as: “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>
          No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary of:<br>
          • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
          • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
          • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>
          Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>
          The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax after a long day at work.<br><br>
          This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>
          Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
          It’s consistent.<br>
          It’s loud.<br>
          And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>
          Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs, at least they’re talkative.<br><br>

      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          Sometimes it feels like the world is moving way faster than anyone can actually keep up with. You open the news and it’s disaster after disaster — conflict here, climate chaos there, politicians arguing like toddlers while everything burns quietly in the background. And somehow we’re supposed to just… get on with our day? Go to class? Pretend everything is fine?<br><br>
          Global issues don’t feel “global” anymore. They feel personal. Close. Like they’re breathing down the back of your neck. When the cost of living spikes on the other side of the world, you feel it in the price of your school lunch. When a country thousands of miles away is flooding, you see it on your timeline before you even brush your teeth. When leaders mess up, it’s our generation that pays for it later — not theirs.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          What’s worse is how normal it’s becoming. We doomscroll until the shock wears off. We watch tragedies like they’re episodes in a series we didn’t ask to binge. The world keeps throwing punches, and everyone’s acting like we should’ve trained for this.<br><br>
          So yes, global issues are more intense, closer, and way harder to ignore. And if you’re a teenager trying to navigate school, friendships, and the looming pressure of life decisions, it’s exhausting.
