    <div class="article-title">West Hallam’s Dog Choir Wakes Residents for No Logical Reason Whatsoever</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous 
            “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.<br><br>

            The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that 
            somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>

            Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as:<br>
            “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>

            No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary of:<br>
            • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
            • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
            • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>

            Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>

            The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax 
            after a long day at work.<br><br>

            This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>

            Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
            It’s consistent.<br>
            It’s loud.<br>
            And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>

            Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs, 
            at least they’re talkative.

    <div class="article-title">Breaking Barriers: Milestones in the Women's Rights Movement</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            Let us consider rights. The battles women have fought, day in and day out for centuries, simply to survive. 
            The changes from the 1700s to the 21st century are striking. Has society changed drastically? Are we aware 
            of the full history? Is enough being done?<br><br>

            1975. Nineteen. Seventy. Five. Women finally secured the right to equal pay. This enabled women to receive 
            the same pay as men for equivalent work, lawfully. It was a crucial step toward equality in society and the 
            workplace. Even today, it reminds us how long women had to wait for this basic human right. Women were 
            granted equal pay rights when the Equal Pay Act 1970 came into effect on 29th December 1975. This 
            legislation marked a major advance in ensuring that men and women received equal pay for equal work, 
            representing a pivotal milestone in the fight for gender equality.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            In the late 19th to early 20th century, women gained the right to freedom. Personal freedom, such as universities. 
            This meant women could legally choose their own path in life and ensure their own future. It was a weighty 
            decision for women who wanted more for their lives, which was most, and this choice meant women could become 
            lawyers, officers of the law or even prime ministers. For example, Margaret Thatcher became the first female 
            Prime Minister of the UK in 1979. Thatcher was seen as a divisive figure, but she proved that women can do 
            the same jobs as men, if not better.<br><br>

            Women’s rights have changed over the years. From being their husband’s property to becoming lawyers and 
            Prime Ministers. Gaining the right to vote, the right to own their own property, and equal pay. Each step has 
            been a crucial progress for the world. These changes remind us how change is created one step at a time.
