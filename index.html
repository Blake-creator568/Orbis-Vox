    <div class="article-title">West Hallam’s Dog Choir Wakes Residents for No Logical Reason Whatsoever</div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <div class="columns">
            <div class="col">
                Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous 
                “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.<br><br>
                The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that 
                somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>
                Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as:<br>
                “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>
                No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary of:<br>
                • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
                • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
                • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>
                Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>
                The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax 
                after a long day at work.<br><br>
                This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>
                Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
                It’s consistent.<br>
                It’s loud.<br>
                And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>
                Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs, 
                at least they’re talkative.

                Let’s talk about rights. The battle women have fought day in and day out for centuries just to survive. The change from the 1700s to the 21st century. Has it changed drastically? Do you know all the history? Are we doing enough?<br><br>
                1975. Nineteen. Seventy. Five. Women finally obtained the right to equal pay. This meant women could legally earn the same as men for doing the same amount of work. It was a crucial step towards equality in the world and workplace. Even today, it reminds us all how long women had to wait for this simple, human right. Women got the right to equal pay when the Equal Pay Act 1970 came into force on 29th December 1975.

            <div class="col">
                In the late 19th to early 20th century, women gained the right to freedom. Personal freedom such as universities. This meant women could legally choose her own path in life and ensure her own future. It was a weighty decision for women who wanted more for their lives, which was most, and this choice meant women could become lawyers, officers of the law or even prime ministers. For example, Margaret Thatcher became the first female Prime Minister of the UK in 1979.<br><br>
                Women’s rights have changed over the years. From being their husband’s property to becoming lawyers and Prime Ministers. Gaining the right to vote, the right to owning their own property, and equal pay. Each step has been crucial progress to the world.

            <div class="col">
                Teenagers. Dramatic or genuinely drained? What do you think? Forty-three percent of teenagers in the UK are exhausted mentally or physically. So, are they being dramatic? Let us find out.<br><br>
                Seventy-five percent of students aged 11 – 18 have complained of feeling overwhelmed about the education system. Many students arrive on time and do their work without showing any exhaustion.

            </div>
            <div class="col">
                Another point to consider is home life. A variety of students have unstable living circumstances. Teenagers do not want to be seen as vulnerable around friends. Relationships can help them cope, though unhealthy relationships increase stress.
