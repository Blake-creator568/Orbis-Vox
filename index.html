    <div class="article-title">A Truthful Look at the BBC Today</div>
    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          There’s something weird about watching the BBC lately. It’s like walking into a familiar room and realising someone’s moved all the furniture around just enough to make you trip. The headlines still look “proper,” the presenters still sit upright like they’ve been ironed flat, but the whole thing feels… tired. Recycled. Like they’re reporting the news from a distance so nobody gets upset.<br><br>
          Scrolling the BBC homepage, you can literally feel the safety net. Everything’s balanced to the point of being bland. A crisis here, a political apology there, the usual “record-breaking something” article, but you’re left thinking: Where’s the edge? Where’s the honesty? Where’s the bit where they admit things are actually going to shit?
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          People my age don’t trust the BBC the way adults assume we do. Not because it’s “biased,” but because it’s polished to death. When everything is sanded smooth for TV, the truth starts slipping off the edges. We don’t need another “government sources say” paragraph — we want the reality underneath: the strain, the impact, the stuff nobody wants to say out loud.<br><br>
          The BBC isn’t evil. It’s just… slow. Heavy. Too careful. And the world right now is anything but careful. Maybe that’s why so many of us end up getting our updates from TikTok at 3am — yeah, it’s messy, but at least it feels awake.

    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          From 2nd December 2025, trans girls are banned from joining Girl Guide groups within the UK. Why was this decision made, and do you agree with it?<br><br>
          This new decision means that girls who were assigned male at birth will no longer be able join Girl Guide groups. The trustees within the organisation that oversees these groups says, <span class="news-source">“Trans girls and young women and others not recorded female at birth, will no longer be able to join Girlguiding as new young members.” They also said that there would be no changes for young women who are already members but more information on this topic will be shared next week. – BBC News.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Many people from the public think it is unfair and discriminative against trans women. <span class="news-source">TransActual said: “There is no problem being solved here, only harm done.”</span> My opinion, this ban seems unfair because every girl should have the right to join. This decision excludes girls who only want to belong by being who they are. – <span class="news-source">BBC News</span>.<br><br>
          What do you think – should all girls be allowed to join, or do you agree with the rules that are set in place?

      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          There’s something underrated about the tiny stupid moments that carry us through the day. Like when someone in your group chat sends a meme so unfunny it becomes actually hilarious. Or when you and your friends laugh so hard in the corridor that a teacher appears out of nowhere like a summoned demon.<br><br>
          Fun at this age isn’t planned. It just happens. It sneaks in between lessons, during the silent bits in class when someone coughs weird, or when you’re walking home hyped on nothing but fresh air and delusion. We don’t get “weekend trips to the coast” fun — we get “laughing for ten straight minutes because someone mispronounced a word” fun.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Adults always talk about “making memories” like it’s some strategic project. But the memories that actually stick are the chaotic ones — the inside jokes, the random late-night FaceTimes, the moments where everything is stupid and pointless and perfect.<br><br>
          Fun isn’t deep. It doesn’t need to be. It’s the crack in the wall that lets the light through when everything else feels heavy. And honestly? Those tiny dumb moments are what keep half of us sane.

    <div class="article-title">West Hallam’s Dog Choir Wakes Residents</div>
    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous 
          “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.<br><br>
          The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that 
          somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>
          Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as:
          “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>
          No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary of:<br>
          • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
          • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
          • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>
          Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>
          The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax 
          after a long day at work.<br><br>
          This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>
          Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
          It’s consistent.<br>
          It’s loud.<br>
          And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>
          Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs, 
          at least they’re talkative.<br><br>

    <div class="article-title">College Chaos Therapy: How Students Unwind</div>

      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          Everyone has their own version of “self-help.”<br><br>
          Some people draw.<br>
          Some people write.<br>
          And then there are college students, whose coping habits can best be described as a Revels chocolate bag – you never know until you bite.<br><br>
          Here’s what most students at Broomfield College said – raw, brutal, and unhinged:
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          • Scream clubs – Loads of people join and scream their lungs out.<br>
          • Burrito yourself – Wrap yourself in a blanket really tight.<br>
          • Exist – Get into bed, be alone, scroll on your phone.<br>
          • Committing arson – DO NOT recommend.<br>
          • Smash some shit – throw plates, punch stuff, be violent.<br>
          • Irritate your siblings – best way to regulate yourself.<br>
          • Aggressive bubble popping – Fidgety, calming, aggressive.<br>
          • Go to bed – nothing like a bit of sleep to make us un-wind.<br>
          • Play online games – alone, or with friends, neither matter just relax.<br>
          • Golfing range – can be relaxing if you don’t smack someone with the club!<br>
          • Blast music – ah, nothing like a bit of eardrum damage to kick off the day.<br><br>
          Chaos activities aren’t about being productive or responsible. They’re about giving your brain a silly, small moment to breathe.<br><br>
          If any of this helps you unwind? Do it proudly.

      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          Ever get one of those days where you wake up ready to tackle the day, but life has other plans. As if waking up early couldn’t get any worse – now life decides this is the perfect day to become a fucking gremlin? Yeah? Me too. Let’s learn together just how much of a gremlin life can be.<br><br>
          Let’s start with phones. If that’s what you can call them now. I think the more appropriate term would be a ‘hand-held bomb.’ Fits, right? The one thing that never shuts up or is abnormally silent. You never know if it’s going to ‘blow up’ or stay neutral. The constant alerts drive us mad. I mean, seriously? Shut up. I haven’t got the patience to keep checking what fucking upgrade I can afford, Vodaphone.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          People. Not just any people, no. The ones who are obnoxiously loud in public spaces. The ones who blast music as they walk with their trousers halfway down their legs. You aren’t a roadman, mate. The ones who shout on phone calls right next to you. I mean, are we being for real? No one needs bleeding eardrums while getting coffee. Dude, turn it down. Yeah, because what I really needed today was a rock concert in the middle of fucking Greggs.<br><br>
          These little things hit like a brick on an already shit day, and yet somehow, we survive to ruin tomorrow all over again.

    <div class="article-title">Why young people are so exhausted all the time</div>
    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          Teenagers. Dramatic or genuinely drained? What do you think? Forty-three percent of teenagers in the UK 
          are exhausted mentally or physically. So, are they being dramatic? Let us find out.<br><br>
          Seventy-five percent of students aged 11–18 have complained of feeling overwhelmed about the education system. 
          This prevents students from achieving what they could be capable of within school hours. Many students arrive 
          on time and do their work without showing any exhaustion. These students do not necessarily have the energy 
          to do this; most will pretend so no one asks questions.<br><br>
          A former pupil at Kirk Hallam Academy said, “I pretended to be okay because it was easier than answering 
          their questions. I told a couple of teachers, but I never got the support I needed which resulted in my 
          self-esteem dropping drastically.”<br><br>
          <img src="images.jpeg" alt="Teenagers looking tired">
          <div class="caption">PHOTO: TEENAGERS’ EXHAUSTION IN THE UK</div>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Another point to consider is home life. A variety of students have unstable living circumstances. 
          As a teenager they find it hard to speak up. Teenagers do not want to be seen as vulnerable around their friends.<br><br>
          One in seven teenagers have reported living in a neglectful home and the toll it has taken on their mental health. 
          How could we change this? Parents/Carers, you need to be more respectful to your children. Most children grow up 
          hating you if you treat them horribly as they are growing.<br><br>
          Relationships. The one thing most teenagers yearn for. Are teenage relationships healthy or are they better off without? 
          Teenage relationships have a profound and dualistic effect on mental health: healthy, supportive relationships function 
          as a vital protective factor, while unhealthy ones increase the risk of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.<br><br>
          In conclusion, most teenagers are overwhelmed by education and family issues. However, relationships can be a solution. 
          The majority of students find comfort in having one familiar person. Teenagers are not being dramatic, they are stressed 
          because of all the pressure from the world around them.

    <div class="article-title">Adulthood’s Footsteps Are Loud</div>
    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          They say adulthood is coming, but no one says how loud its footsteps sound when you’re a teenager.<br><br>
          As a kid you usually envy being a teenager, you can’t wait to grow up. The difference is that when you’re a teenager, you wish to be a kid again. Most teenagers deal with a variety of issues that are common, but some deal with the rarer issues of being forced into adulthood at sixteen. What’s the effect? Let’s have a look.<br><br>
          It’s peculiar living in the in-between. Old enough to know what stress feels like, young enough to know that people still look at you like you’re overreacting. There’s this constant pressure to prepare – for what? Taxes? Food? A home? A whole world that still feels years away but is somehow already on our doorstep, knocking vigorously.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Adults keep telling us, “Enjoy being young while you can” – usually right after reminding us about grades, careers, deadlines, responsibility and something vague called “the real world.” Very relaxing. Thanks.<br><br>
          It’s like living on the edge of a cliff. Knowing one day you’ll fall but don’t know if there will be a safety net. I mean. Who can prepare for everything adults learn over the course of 20-25 years at sixteen? Everyone says it isn’t that big of a deal. Yeah. Says the one chilling at home with their no need for a plan snacks. This isn’t dramatic or attention seeking. It’s normal. It’s human. It shouldn’t be dimmed down or overlooked.<br><br>
          It’s normal to feel overwhelmed. It’s normal to feel exhausted. It’s normal to feel lost. Anyone would. Everyone would. It’s not easy – knowing your life might collapse at any moment. Knowing everything that was steady and secure before is no longer there to lean on. It’s okay, to not understand, to feel lost, and to feel like everything is falling apart. It’s simple really, the truth. Having a deadline for when you must leave home? It’s trauma building in real time. It’s difficult for anyone to understand what it’s like to be an adult, let alone a sixteen-year-old.<br><br>
          Let’s be real. Adulthood can knock later... I’m busy surviving college right now.

      <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
          The world wants me to ‘be myself’ but only the polite, edited, convenient version.<br><br>
          Everyone loves to say “just be yourself” which is hilarious because the second I do, the hidden animals in people just suddenly wake up and start gnawing at my sanity. Like, are we being for real? Yeah, sure. I’ll be myself but don’t blame me when I lose my shit.<br><br>
          The rules of ‘be yourself’ no-one admits: <br>
          • Be confident but not that confident.<br>
          • Have opinions but only the ones we agree with.<br>
          • Speak your mind unless it makes someone uncomfortable.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          • Be unique but don’t stand out too much.<br>
          • Be honest but only if the truth is cute and convenient.<br><br>
          I mean, seriously? We must filter every thought like we’re running our own PR for our personalities. Do we seriously have to filter ourselves to fit in? If being ‘myself’ is too much, that sounds like a ‘them’ problem. If I have to sand down every edge just to make people comfortable, what’s the point of having a personality? Honestly? I’d rather be different than ‘original.’ Wouldn’t you?
