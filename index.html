    <div class="article-title">West Hallam’s Dog Choir Wakes Residents for No Logical Reason Whatsoever</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous 
            “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.<br><br>

            The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that 
            somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>

            Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as:<br>
            “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>

            No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary of:<br>
            • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
            • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
            • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>

            Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>

            The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax 
            after a long day at work.<br><br>

            This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>

            Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
            It’s consistent.<br>
            It’s loud.<br>
            And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>

            Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs, 
            at least they’re talkative.

<div class="article-box">
    <div class="article-title">Milestones in Women’s Rights</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            1975. Nineteen. Seventy. Five. Women finally got the right to equal pay.<br><br>
            This meant that women could legally earn the same as men for doing the same work. 
            It was an important step toward fairness in the workplace. Even today, it reminds us 
            how long people had to wait for this basic right.<br><br>

            Women had also gradually gained the right to own property in the late 19th century. 
            Laws like the Married Women’s Property Act allowed women to control their own money and possessions, 
            giving them more independence and security.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            These milestones were part of a broader movement for women’s freedom, 
            including the right to vote, access to education, and participation in public life.<br><br>

            Every achievement built on the last, showing that progress is often slow but meaningful. 
            Remembering these steps encourages us to continue striving for equality today.<br><br>
