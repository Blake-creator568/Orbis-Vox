    <div class="article-title">West Hallam’s Dog Choir Wakes Residents for No Logical Reason Whatsoever</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous 
            “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.<br><br>

            The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that 
            somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>

            Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as:<br>
            “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>

            No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary of:<br>
            • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
            • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
            • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>

            Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>

            The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax 
            after a long day at work.<br><br>

            This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>

            Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
            It’s consistent.<br>
            It’s loud.<br>
            And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>

            Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs, 
            at least they’re talkative.

    <div class="article-title">Breaking Barriers: Milestones in the Women's Rights Movement</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            Let’s talk about rights. The battle women have fought day in and day out for centuries just to survive. The change from the 1700s to the 21st century. Has it changed drastically? Do you know all the history? Are we doing enough?<br><br>

            1975. Nineteen. Seventy. Five. Women finally obtained the right to equal pay. This meant women could legally earn the same as men for doing the same amount of work. It was a crucial step towards equality in the world and workplace. Even today, it reminds us all how long women had to wait for this simple, human right.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            In the late 19th to early 20th century, women gained the right to freedom. Personal freedom such as universities. This meant women could legally choose her own path in life and ensure her own future.<br><br>

            Women’s rights have changed over the years — from being their husband’s property to becoming lawyers and Prime Ministers.

        <div class="col">
            Teenagers. Dramatic or genuinely drained? What do you think? Forty-three percent of teenagers in the UK are exhausted mentally or physically.<br><br>

            Seventy-five percent of students aged 11–18 have complained of feeling overwhelmed about the education system.

            Home life, unstable living circumstances, relationships, and school pressure all take a toll on teenagers.<br><br>

            In conclusion: teenagers are not dramatic — they’re exhausted.
