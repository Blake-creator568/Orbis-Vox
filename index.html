    <div class="article-title">West Hallam’s Dog Choir Wakes Residents for No Logical Reason Whatsoever</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            <p>Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous 
            “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.</p>

            The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that 
            somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>

            Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as:<br>
            “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>

            No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary:<br>
            • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
            • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
            • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>

            Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>

            The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax 
            after a long day at work.<br><br>

            This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>

            Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
            It’s consistent.<br>
            It’s loud.<br>
            And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>

            Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs—at least they’re talkative.

    <div class="article-title">Breaking Barriers: Milestones in the Women's Rights Movement</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            <p>Let’s talk about rights. The battle women have fought day in and day out for centuries just to survive. 
            The change from the 1700s to the 21st century. Has it changed drastically? Do you know all the history? 
            Are we doing enough?</p>

            1975. Nineteen. Seventy. Five. Women finally obtained the right to equal pay. This meant women could legally 
            earn the same as men for doing the same amount of work. It was a crucial step towards equality.  
            Women got the right to equal pay when the Equal Pay Act 1970 came into force on 29th December 1975.  
            This legislation marked a pivotal moment in the fight for gender equality.
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            In the late 19th to early 20th century, women gained the right to freedom — including access to universities.  
            This meant women could legally choose their own path and future. From lawyers to prime ministers, women 
            finally had the opportunity to reach the same careers as men.<br><br>

            For example, Margaret Thatcher became the first female Prime Minister of the UK in 1979.  
            Thatcher proved women can do the same jobs men can — if not better.<br><br>

            Women’s rights have changed dramatically: from being property to voting, to equal pay, to leadership roles.  
            These changes remind us that progress happens one step at a time.

    <div class="article-title">Why young people are so exhausted all the time</div>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            <p>Teenagers. Dramatic or genuinely drained? What do you think? Forty-three percent of teenagers in the UK 
            are exhausted mentally or physically. So, are they being dramatic? Let us find out.</p>

            Seventy-five percent of students aged 11–18 have complained of feeling overwhelmed by the education system.  
            Many arrive on time, do their work, and hide exhaustion because pretending is easier than explaining.  
            One former pupil at Kirk Hallam Academy said:  
            “I pretended to be okay because it was easier than answering their questions… my self-esteem dropped 
            drastically.”<br><br>

            <img src="images.jpeg" alt="Teenagers looking tired">
            <div class="caption">PHOTO: TEENAGERS’ EXHAUSTION IN THE UK</div>
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            Another point to consider is home life. Many teenagers have unstable living circumstances.  
            One in seven teenagers report living in neglectful homes, deeply affecting mental health.<br><br>

            Then there are relationships. Romantic relationships can protect mental health — or damage it.  
            Healthy ones offer support; unhealthy ones increase anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.<br><br>

            In conclusion: teenagers are overwhelmed by school, home life, and personal pressures.  
            They aren’t being dramatic — they’re exhausted.  
            Schools should understand before punishing.  
            Parents should listen before judging.
