        <div class="columns">
          <div class="col">
            From 2nd December 2025, trans girls are banned from joining Girl Guide groups within the UK. Why was this decision made, and do you agree with it?<br><br>

            This new decision means that girls who were assigned male at birth will no longer be able join Girl Guide groups. The trustees within the organisation that oversees these groups says, <span class="news-source">“Trans girls and young women and others not recorded female at birth, will no longer be able to join Girlguiding as new young members.” They also said that there would be no changes for young women who are already members but more information on this topic will be shared next week. – BBC News.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            Many people from the public think it is unfair and discriminative against trans women. <span class="news-source">TransActual said: “There is no problem being solved here, only harm done.”</span> My opinion, this ban seems unfair because every girl should have the right to join. This decision excludes girls who only want to belong by being who they are. – <span class="news-source">BBC News</span>.<br><br>

            What do you think – should all girls be allowed to join, or do you agree with the rules that are set in place?

          <div class="col">
            Thousands of students across the country have organized a coordinated school strike to demand more action on climate change. The movement, led by youth activists, is gaining momentum, with protests held outside government buildings and in city centers. Students expressed frustration over slow policy changes and urge lawmakers to take immediate measures to combat environmental issues.
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            "We need to be heard, and we are taking our future into our own hands," said one student leader. Teachers and parents have shown mixed reactions, ranging from support to concern over missed lessons. The strike highlights the growing influence of young voices in shaping national policy and awareness on critical issues affecting future generations.

      <div class="article-content">
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="col">
            Residents across West Hallam were startled awake at an insane hour this morning as the village’s infamous 
            “Dog Choir” began another full-volume performance.<br><br>
            The chaos always begins the same way: one dog, somewhere in the distance, lets out a single bark that 
            somehow sounds like someone has stubbed their toe.<br><br>
            Within seconds, every single dog in the village has a turn, creating a racket that can only be described as:
            “Someone listening to their phone on full blast.”<br><br>
            No one knows what throws them off. Some assumed triggers by families vary of:<br>
            • A gust of wind that suspiciously sounds like a whistle.<br>
            • A leaf flying by with a look of disgust.<br>
            • Or even the insane concept of being awake before 8AM.<br><br>
            Some residents suggest the canines may be assembling their choir with military precision.
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            I’m convinced they hold meetings through Skype when we are away.<br><br>
            The barking usually reaches maximum volume at the exact moment you were finally about to sit down and relax 
            after a long day at work.<br><br>
            This leaves locals feeling ready to sue the entire canine population.<br><br>
            Despite the daily chaos, many admit the barking has become part of West Hallam life.<br>
            It’s consistent.<br>
            It’s loud.<br>
            And it absolutely doesn’t care that you have college in an hour.<br><br>
            Well, at least someone in this village has some variation of entertainment. Can’t blame the dogs, 
            at least they’re talkative.<br><br>

            Let’s talk about rights. The battle women have fought day in and day out for centuries just to survive. 
            The change from the 1700s to the 21st century. Has it changed drastically? Do you know all the history? 
            Are we doing enough?<br><br>

            1975. Nineteen. Seventy. Five. Women finally obtained the right to equal pay. This meant women could legally earn the same as men for doing the same amount of work. It was a crucial step towards equality in the world and workplace. Even today, it reminds us all how long women had to wait for this simple, human right. Women got the right to equal pay when the Equal Pay Act 1970 came into force on 29th December 1975. This legislation was a major step in ensuring that men and women receive equal pay for equal work, marking a pivotal moment in the fight for gender equality.
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            In the late 19th to early 20th century, women gained the right to freedom. Personal freedom such as universities. 
            This meant women could legally choose her own path in life and ensure her own future. It was a weighty decision 
            for women who wanted more for their lives, which was most, and this choice meant women could become lawyers, 
            officers of the law or even prime ministers.<br><br>

            For example, Margaret Thatcher became the first female Prime Minister of the UK in 1979. 
            Thatcher was seen as a divisive figure, but she proved women can do the same jobs men can, if not better.<br><br>

            Women’s rights have changed over the years. From being their husband’s property to becoming lawyers and Prime Ministers. 
            Gaining the right to vote, the right to owning their own property, and equal pay. Each step has been crucial 
            progress to the world. These changes remind us how change is created one step at a time.

      <div class="article-title">Why young people are so exhausted all the time</div>
      <div class="article-content">
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="col">
            Teenagers. Dramatic or genuinely drained? What do you think? Forty-three percent of teenagers in the UK 
            are exhausted mentally or physically. So, are they being dramatic? Let us find out.<br><br>

            Seventy-five percent of students aged 11–18 have complained of feeling overwhelmed about the education system. 
            This prevents students from achieving what they could be capable of within school hours. Many students arrive 
            on time and do their work without showing any exhaustion. These students do not necessarily have the energy 
            to do this; most will pretend so no one asks questions.<br><br>

            A former pupil at Kirk Hallam Academy said, “I pretended to be okay because it was easier than answering 
            their questions. I told a couple of teachers, but I never got the support I needed which resulted in my 
            self-esteem dropping drastically.”<br><br>

            <img src="images.jpeg" alt="Teenagers looking tired">
            <div class="caption">PHOTO: TEENAGERS’ EXHAUSTION IN THE UK</div>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            Another point to consider is home life. A variety of students have unstable living circumstances. 
            As a teenager they find it hard to speak up. Teenagers do not want to be seen as vulnerable around their friends.<br><br>

            One in seven teenagers have reported living in a neglectful home and the toll it has taken on their mental health. 
            How could we change this? Parents/Carers, you need to be more respectful to your children. Most children grow up 
            hating you if you treat them horribly as they are growing.<br><br>

            Relationships. The one thing most teenagers yearn for. Are teenage relationships healthy or are they better off without? 
            Teenage relationships have a profound and dualistic effect on mental health: healthy, supportive relationships function 
            as a vital protective factor, while unhealthy ones increase the risk of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.<br><br>

            In conclusion, most teenagers are overwhelmed by education and family issues. However, relationships can be a solution. 
            The majority of students find comfort in having one familiar person. Teenagers are not being dramatic, they are stressed 
            because of all the pressure from the world around them.
